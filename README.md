# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
 This repository contains the code and data for a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on their health data. By analyzing factors such as age, BMI, glucose levels, and blood pressure, the model provides a prediction of whether a patient is likely to develop diabetes in the future.
